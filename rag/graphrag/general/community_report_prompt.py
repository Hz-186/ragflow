"""
社区报告提示词模板 —— 让 LLM 给一个「社区」（实体圈子）写结构化综述报告。

本文件只有一个字符串常量 COMMUNITY_REPORT_PROMPT，它是数据不是代码，
一个字符都不要改（包括里面的英文原文——那是给 LLM 看的指令）。

谁来用它：
    general/community_reports_extractor.py 的 CommunityReportsExtractor.__call__
    里，每处理一个社区就执行：
        perform_variable_replacements(COMMUNITY_REPORT_PROMPT, variables={
            "entity_df":   实体清单 CSV 文本,
            "relation_df": 关系清单 CSV 文本,
        })
    然后把填好的提示词当 system 消息、user 只发 "Output:" 去问 LLM。

两个占位符（唯一会被替换的空位）：
    {entity_df}    → 社区成员清单，形如：
                         id,entity,description
                         0,张三,北京大学教授
                         1,李四,张三的学生
    {relation_df}  → 圈内关系清单，形如：
                         id,source,target,description
                         0,张三,李四,师生关系

双花括号 {{ }} 的来历：
    模板里的 JSON 示例用了 {{ }} 转义写法（防止被当作占位符误替换）；
    LLM 照抄示例也会吐出 {{ }}，所以解析端（community_reports_extractor）
    在 json.loads 之前会把 {{ 和 }} 还原成单花括号。

要求 LLM 产出的五个字段（缺一即判失败，社区报告作废）：
    title              社区标题（尽量带上代表性实体名）
    summary            执行摘要：社区结构、实体间关联、重要信息
    rating             0~10 的影响力评分（浮点数）
    rating_explanation 一句话解释这个评分
    findings           5~10 条「关键洞察」，每条 = 小标题 + 多段论证；
                       论证必须按 Grounding Rules 引用数据编号
                       （[Data: Entities (5), Relationships (37, 38)] 这种格式）

中间那一大段 Verdant Oasis Plaza / Unity March 的例子是 few-shot 示例：
实体是虚构的，专门演示「报告应该长什么样、引用应该怎么标」。

COMMUNITY_REPORT_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant that helps a human analyst to perform general information discovery. Information discovery is the process of identifying and assessing relevant information associated with certain entities (e.g., organizations and individuals) within a network.

# Goal
Write a comprehensive report of a community, given a list of entities that belong to the community as well as their relationships and optional associated claims. The report will be used to inform decision-makers about information associated with the community and their potential impact. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities, their legal compliance, technical capabilities, reputation, and noteworthy claims.

# Report Structure

The report should include the following sections:

- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.
- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant information associated with its entities.
- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: a float score between 0-10 that represents the severity of IMPACT posed by entities within the community.  IMPACT is the scored importance of a community.
- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the IMPACT severity rating.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format(in language of 'Text' content):
    {{
        "title": <report_title>,
        "summary": <executive_summary>,
        "rating": <impact_severity_rating>,
        "rating_explanation": <rating_explanation>,
        "findings": [
            {{
                "summary":<insight_1_summary>,
                "explanation": <insight_1_explanation>
            }},
            {{
                "summary":<insight_2_summary>,
                "explanation": <insight_2_explanation>
            }}
        ]
    }}

# Grounding Rules

Points supported by data should list their data references as follows:

"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)]."

Do not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

For example:
"Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Reports (1), Entities (5, 7); Relationships (23); Claims (7, 2, 34, 64, 46, +more)]."

where 1, 5, 7, 23, 2, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data record.

Do not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.
